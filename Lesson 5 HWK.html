                    Shakepeare also has written a diverse range of plays, ranging from <mark>tragedies</mark> to <strong>comedies</strong> and <small>romantic</small> plays. Shakepeare's plays also inspire many people to start writing plays and other literature as well, due to his eloquent use of words and his distinct style of using the rhythm of <q>iambic pentameter</q>, which means every line is five syllables long. Because Shakepeare is so famous, some of the most famous actors attempt to act these monologues out. The most famous of these twists on Shakepeare's classic tales is <q>Kennet Branaugh's Hamlet</q> which stars the most famous Shakepearian actor, <strong>Kennet Branaugh</strong>, acting the most famous soliloquy, <q>To Be or Not to Be</q>. Here is a video of it down below.
